# PID Controller

The simulator used for this project can be found at this link:

https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/v1.45

The PID files show the code behind the PID controller. The "main.cpp" file allows for modification of the PID controller parameters.

# Steps for running the code:

1. Download the file named "Code".

2. Run the install-ubuntu.sh file on the ubuntu terminal. (./install-ubuntu.sh)

3. Run the build.sh file on the ubuntu terminal. (./build.sh)

4. A new folder named "build" will be created, enter this file using the ubuntu terminal. (cd build)

5. Run the file named pid. (./pid)

6. This will activate the websocket connection.

7. Open the simulator and run the PID control project, and watch the car run autonomously.
