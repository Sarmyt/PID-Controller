# PID Controller

The simulator used for this project can be found at this link:

https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/v1.45

The PID files show the code behind the PID controller. The "main.cpp" file allows for modification of the PID controller parameters.

# Steps for running the code:

1. Download the file named "Code".

2. Run the install-ubuntu.sh file on the ubuntu terminal. 

3. Run the build.sh file on the ubuntu terminal.

4. A new folder named "Build" will be created.

5. Enter this folder using the ubuntu terminal, and run the file named pid.

6. This will activate the websocket connection.

7. Open the simulator and run the PID control project, and watch the car run autonomously.
